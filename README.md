# remote-temperature-management

The remote temperature management module built for the Execute hackathon is a module in the Supply chain of vaccines.

Vaccines that are stored at cold temperatures require constant temperature monitoring. This module eliminates that with the help of a RTM and ensures the temperatures are in the optimal range by alerting the operator the moment they approach the limit.
